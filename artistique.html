    <p>What is niche perfumery? At one time, niche perfumes were defined like this: Fragrances that are not for everyone, absent advertising, exclusive distribution(a limited number of stores), higher cost compared to the luxury segment, the author's conceptual approach to creating fragrances, and unified bottles and packaging.</p>
    <br/><br/>
    <p>Frederic Malle made perfumers to be the stars of his Fragrances, and this approach became typical, spreading to many niche brands(Parfumkunstwerke, Essential Parfums, Masque Milano, etc). The purchase of niche brands by large corporations(Tom Ford, Altelier cologne, By kilian, Maison Francis Kurkgjian etc) and the release of exclusive niche collections by almost all major luxury brands(Chanel, Guerlain, Van Cleef and Aperls, Mugler, Carolina Herrera, etc) led to a sharp expansion lof their points of sale: Niche brands began to create advertising posters and commercials; Fragrances on the most popular themes appeared ion the assortment of niche brands. In the recent yeats, an inexpensive niche brand has also appeared: the Wide Society, step aboard, Essential Parfums, Maison Matine...The concept of niche has been blurred. In Italy, they even came up with a new definition: "artistic perfumery", or perfumery as art.</p>

    <p>The three new fragrances from the Atistique Parfumiers by Avon collection were created to elevate the brand's perfumes to the level of art. Judge for yourself. These three Avon fragrances are built around fragrant themes by which new perfume brands begin their new collections: irises, amber and flowers. (Moreover there is a special twists in these perfumes: gourmet iris, amber with a woody ascent on patchouli, and a floural perfume on the magnolia theme.)</p>
    <br/><br/>
    <p>Famous Symrise perfumers with international recognition, who are famous for their creations on a specific fragrance theme, were involved in the creation of the Artistique Avon fragrances.</p>

    <p>Emelie Coppermann, before creating Iris Fetiche, was known for her iris scents for Van Cleef and Arpels, The Different Company, and Wide Society. Alexandra Carlin created Patchouli Indulgence following fragrances for Amouage, Mauboussin, Luisa Spagnoli, Givenchy L'Atelier, and ferarri. Before creating Magnolia en Fleurs, Maurice Roucel created a lot of floral perfumes using magnolia for Gucci, Guerlain Missoni, and UERMI, and he was generally the first to use a magnolia fragrance in Tocade Rochas</p>
    <br/><br/>
    <p>The bottles of Artistique are unified. Each box and label of these Avon copyrighted fragrances has been personal signature of its perfumer-"crafted M.Roucel-E Coppermann-A Carlin"-as a quality mark.</p>

    <p>A fragrance for a bold, confident and courageous woman, Patchouli Indulgence is a fascinating mixture of patchouli,exotic spices, delicate floral shades, and a rich amber base. The floral oriental fragrance signed by Alexandra Carlin with its whirlwind of captivating woody shades is ideal for those who are not afraid to go against the tide; it conjures up memories of exotic countries. The fragrance was born  from the memory of one warm evening spent by Alexandra in the night market of the Vietnamese Hoi An on the sahore of South China Sea, among the warm smells of spices, flowers, and woods.</p>

    <p><b>"creating a fragrance is like tellig a story. Finding the perfect accord that will touch the heart of others. I make each of the raw materials play a specific role so as not to disappear in the scent. I think this is my signature." -Alexandra Carlin</b></p>
